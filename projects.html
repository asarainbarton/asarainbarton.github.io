            <h2 class="subheader-font">Allows users to hide any type of data imaginable inside of one or multiple photos</h2>
            <p>
                This program enables users to conceal a wide range of data within one or multiple photos. This includes, but is not limited to, text, PDFs,
                sound files, images, and even entire Minecraft worlds. The technique used is called steganography, where data is hidden in plain sight,
                imperceptible to the naked eye. In our case, data is converted into bit format and discreetly stored in the least significant bits of the
                red, green, and blue color values of each pixel. Retrieving this hidden data requires both knowledge of its presence in the image(s) and the
                use of the appropriate extraction technology, which is also available here.

            <p>
                Using pure logic, this AI is able to flag tiles containing bombs and unflag all other tiles in the game of Minesweeper. The goal 
                is to uncover all tiles that don't have bombs. If a bomb is uncovered, the player loses. On 8x8 grids, this AI has roughly a 67%
                success rate on any given 8x8 grid with 10 hidden bombs and a 59% success rate on 16x16 grids with 40 bombs.

            <p>
                Allows a user to send commands to the operating system and allows the operating system to respond to the user by printing output
                to the screen. The shell allows a simple character-oriented interface in which the user types a string of characters (terminated
                by pressing 'ENTER') and the operating system responds by printing lines of characters back to the screen.

            <p>
                Two processes get run: One for the client which will query price data and one for the server which will extract the appropriate
                information from its database and send it to the user. The client can examine stock prices for two major stocks: TESLA (TSLA)
                and Microsoft (MSFT). The user enters commands into the client program which runs on one machine. The machine run on the server
                can either be the same machine as the client (as a separate process) or any authorized remote machine containing a valid IP
                address/host name. Both client and server communicate using TCP/IP so an appropriate listening port number is provided.

            <p>
                One-player Texas Hold'em Poker game implemented in Python using the Pygame library and a custom card and deck class. The player
                and computer are each dealt a random set of two cards. An additional set of cards are dealt on the table (3 + 1 + 1). After each
                new deal, the player must choose to either call, raise, or fold. Once all cards are dealt, the program determines the winner by 
                comparing the player's and computer's hands against the set of 5 card laid out. The player can then choose to play again or exit.
